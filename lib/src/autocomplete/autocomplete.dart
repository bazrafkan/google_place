  /// The Place Autocomplete service is a web service that returns place predictions in response

  /// geographic searches, by returning places such as businesses, addresses and points of
  /// interest as a user types.
  ///
  /// [input] Required parameters - The text string on which to search. The Place Autocomplete
  /// service will return candidate matches based on this string and order results based on
  ///  their perceived relevance.
  ///
  /// [sessionToken] Optional parameters - A random string which identifies an autocomplete
  /// session for billing purposes. If this parameter is omitted from an autocomplete request,
  /// the request is billed independently. See the pricing sheet for details.
  ///
  /// [offset] Optional parameters - The position, in the input term, of the last character
  /// that the service uses to match predictions. For example, if the input is 'Google' and the
  /// offset is 3, the service will match on 'Goo'. The string determined by the offset is
  /// matched against the first word in the input term only. For example, if the input term is
  /// 'Google abc' and the offset is 3, the service will attempt to match against 'Goo abc'.
  /// If no offset is supplied, the service will use the whole term. The offset should generally
  /// be set to the position of the text caret.
  ///
  /// [origin] Optional parameters - The origin point from which to calculate straight-line
  /// distance to the destination (returned as distance_meters). If this value is omitted,
  /// straight-line distance will not be returned. Must be specified as latitude,longitude.
  ///
  /// [location] Optional parameters - The point around which you wish to retrieve place
  /// information. Must be specified as latitude,longitude.
  ///
  /// [radius] Optional parameters - The distance (in meters) within which to return place results.
  ///  Note that setting a radius biases results to the indicated area, but may not fully restrict
  /// results to the specified area. See Location Biasing and Location Restrict below.
  ///
  /// [region] Optional parameters - The region code, specified as a ccTLD (country code top-level domain)
  /// two-character value. Most ccTLD codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes, with some exceptions.
  /// This parameter will only influence, not fully restrict, results. If more relevant results
  ///  exist outside of the specified region, they may be included. When this parameter is used,
  ///  the country name is omitted from the resulting formatted_address for results in the specified region.
  ///
  /// [language] Optional parameters -  The language code, indicating in which language the results
  ///  should be returned, if possible. Searches are also biased to the selected language; results
  /// in the selected language may be given a higher ranking. See the list of supported languages
  /// and their codes. Note that we often update supported languages so this list may not be
  /// exhaustive. If language is not supplied, the Place Autocomplete service will attempt to use
  /// the native language of the domain from which the request is sent.
  ///
  /// [types] Optional parameters - The types of place results to return. See Place Types below.
  /// If no type is specified, all types will be returned.
  ///
  /// [components] Optional parameters - A grouping of places to which you would like to restrict
  /// your results. Currently, you can use components to filter by up to 5 countries. Countries
  /// must be passed as a two character, ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 compatible country code.

  /// [strictbounds] Optional parameters - Returns only those places that are strictly within
  /// the region defined by location and radius. This is a restriction, rather than a bias,
  /// meaning that results outside this region will not be returned even if they match the user input.
